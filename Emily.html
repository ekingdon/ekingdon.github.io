  <div class="AboutMe">
    <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Emily is the right hand Elf to the head honcho, the head cheese, the man himself, 
          the Big Red, the Claus of all Clauses, the one and only, Santa. 
          She grew up in a small village 50 km south of the north pole, the toy town as it was refered to. She started 
          as the summer elf wrapping presents in 1802 for Mr Claus, it was my first real job in the toy industry. 
          In her late 30s she was a supervisor in the designing department, a big step for an elf. Emily 
        designed everything from toy trains to supersonic gumdrop shooters for the governement elf squadrons! 
          Emily's next promotion led her here when Mr. Claus himself mentored her in the sleigh industry. 
          Eventually becoming head mechanic then head elf which is she has held for 85 years!</p>
        
        <p> So if you are looking for a great reliable sleigh, trust this old Elf, we know our stuff!</p>
